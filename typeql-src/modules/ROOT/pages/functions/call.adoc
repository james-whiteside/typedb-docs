= Call

Calling a function is equal to using its output in a pattern.

== Syntax

To call a function, use its label in a `match` clause or another function's body.
Input parameters are set in the parentheses right after the label.
If no input parameters are needed for the function, use empty parentheses to call it.

[,typeql]
----
<label> "(" [<param> = ] <var> [, [<param> = ] <var>] ")"
----

where `<label>` is the label of the function to call,
`<param>` is the name of the input parameter (optional),
`<var>` is a query variable.

== Behavior

To call a function, it needs to be xref:functions/definition.adoc[defined] first.
A function call is effectively substituted with the returned output of the function.

== Usage

// include::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

.Function definition example

----
match
$n in extended_name($x);
