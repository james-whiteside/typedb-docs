= Output

Functions return either a stream of results or a single aggregated value.

== Syntax

An output returned by a function is declared in the function xref:functions/definition.adoc[definition]
after the `return` keyword:

[,typeql]
----
return "{" <var> [, <var>] "}" ;
----

== Behavior

To get output as a stream of results, use a variable from the matched pattern.
For every matched results, the function will provide the specified value of the variable in the results.

To get output as a single aggregated value, use one of the built-in
xref:query-design/post-processing.adoc#_aggregation_reduction[aggregation functions].

== Usage

// include::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

.Functions return example
[,typeql]
----
return { name, birthday, bool };
