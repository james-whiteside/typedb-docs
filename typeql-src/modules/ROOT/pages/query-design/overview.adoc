= Queries

TypeQL queries are written in TypeQL and can be used either to modify a schema of a database or to manipulate its data.

== Query types

A schema definition query (or schema query) can be either a Define or Undefine query.
However, a data manipulation query (or data query) can use multiple clauses in any combination,
so it can't always be so easily classified.
