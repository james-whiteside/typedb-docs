= Pre-processing

Pre-processing is used in data queries to define new functions used in the query.
These newly defined functions are not persisted in the database.

== Syntax
// tag::syntax[]
A pre-processing clause uses the `with` keyword followed by function definitions, separated by :

[,typeql]
----
with <function-definition>; [<function-definition>;]
----

// end::syntax[]

== Behavior

Functions defined in the pre-processing section of a data query are treated similar to functions
defined in the schema of a database.
The only difference is that these functions are not persisted in the schema, so they don't exist for other queries.

== Usage example

[,typeql]
----
with fun FUN_NAME(INPUT_TYPE) -> RETURN_TYPE : FUN_BODY RETURN
----
