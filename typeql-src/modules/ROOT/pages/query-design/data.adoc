= Data manipulation queries

TypeDB 3.0+ uses data processing pipeline approach to query design.
A query consists of one or multiple clauses that are executed one after another passing the results between clauses via
<<_concept_streaming>>.

== Combining clauses

To design a data manipulating query, use any combination of the following clauses:

* match
* insert
* delete
* put
* assert

A data manipulating clause of every type can be used more than once in any data query.
