= plays

The `plays` keyword is used in TypeQL schema to declare a subject type as a valid player of a role in a relation type.

== Syntax

The syntax of a `plays` statement includes:

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<player> "plays" <relation-type:role> [as overridden-type];
----

An optional <<_usage_with_override,override>> can be added at the end.

== Behavior

The `plays` keyword declares an ability to play a role.

TypeQL statements with the `plays` keyword can be used only in schema queries to modify a schema,
or in data queries to match data using types information.

== Usage in a schema definition

include::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Since in Define and Undefine queries you can't use variables,
both subject and object can only be type labels.
The object is always a scoped type label that consists of a relation type and a role separated by a colon.

For example, to define the `subject` type to be able to play the `subject` role in the `premission` relation type, use:

.Define role query example
[,typeql]
----
define
subject plays permission:subject;
----

To remove the new role, use:

.Undefine query example
[,typeql]
----
undefine
subject plays permission:subject;
----

[#_usage_with_override]
== Usage with override

include::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

By default, a subtype of a relation type inherits all roles that were defined for its supertype.
To override an inherited role, use the `as` keyword.
The overridden new role must be a subtype of the inherited role.
//#todo Show how to subtype a role

Let's see an example, of a schema, where the `owned` role of the `ownership` relation type gets overridden by
the `object` role:

.Override owned attribute type example
[,typeql]
----
define
subject plays permission:manager as subject;
----
//#todo Improve example for reproducability
