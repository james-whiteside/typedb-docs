= in

The `in` keyword can be used to bind results returned by a function to query variables in a data query.

== Syntax

The syntax of an `in` statement includes:

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<var> in <function>;
----

where `<var>` is a comma-separated list

== Behavior

A function can return a stream of tuples or reduce it to a single aggregated value.
A statement with the `in` keyword binds a query variable for every returned element of tuple.



== Usage

For example, we can match

.Example of in statement
[,typeql]
----
match
$berlin isa city, has name "Berlin";
$other_city in north_of($berlin);
----
