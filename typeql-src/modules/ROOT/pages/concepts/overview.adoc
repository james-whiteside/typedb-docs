TypeQL can be used for polymorphic queries with patterns using xref:concepts/variables.adoc[variables].
A variable represents an unknown element, that we can constrain with TypeQL
xref:statements/overview.adoc[statements] in a pattern.

When a xref:patterns/overview.adoc[pattern] is solved,
query engine finds all values and/or concepts that every variable can take
to statisfy all the constraints of the query.

A Concept can be either a data instance from a database or a type from its schema.

For information on values that a variable can take, see the xref:values/overview.adoc[] page.
