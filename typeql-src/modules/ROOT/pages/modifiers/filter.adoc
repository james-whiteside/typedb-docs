= Filter

This page covers the filter modifier for filtering TypeQL query results.

== Syntax

A filter modifier syntax consists of the `filter` keyword followed by a comma separated list of variables
to include in the output:

[,typeql]
----
filter <var> [, <var>] ;
----

== Behavior

Filter modifier specifies what variables to keep in the outputted Concept Map.
All other variables are dropped from the output and that can lead to fewer results due to deduplication.

== Usage
