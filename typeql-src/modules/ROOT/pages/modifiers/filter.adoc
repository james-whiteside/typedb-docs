= Filter

This page covers the filter modifier for filtering the output of a data processing clause.

== Syntax

A filter modifier syntax consists of the `filter` keyword followed by a comma separated list of variables
to include in the output:

[,typeql]
----
filter <var> [, <var>] ;
----

== Behavior

Filter modifier specifies what variables to keep in the outputted Concept Map.
All other variables are dropped from the output and that can lead to having fewer results in the output
due to deduplication.

== Usage
