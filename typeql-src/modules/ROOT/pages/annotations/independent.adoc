= Independent

The independent annotation can be used for attributes that can become orphaned (not having an owner by anything)
and should not be deleted from a database in that case.

== Syntax

The syntax of a independent annotation includes the `@independent` keyword
placed after a xref:statements/sub.adoc[sub statement] of an attribute type:

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<sub-statement> @independent ;
----

== Behavior

An attribute type defined with the independent annotation is preserved in the database
in case all ownerships of it get deleted.

=== Orphaned attributes

An attribute is called orphaned when there are no more owners in the database to have it.
Be default, TypeDB 3.0+ deletes orphaned attributes to free up storage space.

== Usage

.Independent attribute example
[,typeql]
----
name sub attribute @independent, value string;
----
