= Debug

The debug annotation is used for debug output.

== Syntax

The syntax of a debug annotation includes the `@debug` keyword placed after the clause definitive keyword:

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<clause-keyword> @debug ;
----

where `<clause-keyword>` can be one of the keywords starting a clause in a TypeQL data processing pipeline.

== Behavior

The debug annotation enables logging or printing of clause's input and output,
as well as other useful debugging information.
//#todo add info on behavior and output formats

== Usage

To have debug output, place the `@debug` annotation after the clause defining keyword.
For example, to have a debug output of a `match` clause:

.Debug match clause
[,typeql]
----
match @debug
$x has $y;
filter $y;
----
