= Distinct

The distinct annotation ensures there are no duplicates in a list.

== Syntax

The syntax of a distinct annotation includes the `@distinct` keyword placed after a list in a schema statement:

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<list> @distinct ;
----
//<owns/relate-statement>

== Behavior

A list with the distinct annotation must not have duplicates.

By default, lists can have duplicates.

== Usage

To restrict a list to contain no duplicates,
place the `@distinct` annotation after the list declaration in a schema definition.
For example, to have a distinct list of roleplayers for a role `edge`:

.Distinct list
[,typeql]
----
define
Len_3_path sub relation,
    relates edge[] @card(3) @distinct;
----
