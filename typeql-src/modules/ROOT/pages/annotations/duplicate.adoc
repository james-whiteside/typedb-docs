= Duplicate

The duplicate annotation enables an ability to have duplicates of elements in a list.

== Syntax

The syntax of a duplicate annotation includes the `@duplicate` keyword placed after a list in a schema statement:

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<list> @duplicate ;
----
//<owns/relate-statement>

== Behavior

A list with the duplicate annotation can have duplicates.
//#todo Double-check the behavior as it doesn't make sense

== Usage

To allow a list to contain duplicates,
place the `@duplicate` annotation after the list declaration in a schema definition.
For example, to have a list of roleplayers for a role `edge` with duplicates:

.Duplicate list
[,typeql]
----
define
Len_3_path sub relation,
    relates edge[] @card(3) @duplicate;
----
//#todo Double-check that the example makes sense, since
