Clause keywords declare a start of a query's clause:

`define`::
Starts a `define` clause of a xref:queries/define.adoc[].

`undefine`::
Starts an `undefine` clause of a xref:queries/undefine.adoc[]

`match`::
Starts a `match` clause that xref:patterns/matching.adoc[matches existing data] by a pattern in an
xref:queries/insert.adoc[Insert],
xref:queries/delete.adoc[Delete],
xref:queries/update.adoc[Update],
xref:queries/fetch.adoc[Fetch], or
xref:queries/get.adoc[Get] query.

`insert`::
Starts an `insert` clause of an xref:queries/insert.adoc[].

`delete`::
Starts a `delete` clause of a xref:queries/delete.adoc[].

`fetch`::
Starts a `fetch` clause of a xref:queries/fetch.adoc[].

`get`::
Starts a `get` clause of a xref:queries/get.adoc[].

== Schema statements

Schema statement keywords used inside a clause of a query as a part of a data pattern or a schema definition:
//Schema statements are used to specify types in both data queries and schema queries.

`sub`::
Adds a constraint on a type to be any subtype of a given type. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/sub.adoc[] page.

`sub!`::
Adds a constraint on a type to be a direct subtype of a given type. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/sub.adoc[] page.

`type`::
Adds a constraint on a type to be an exact type by its label. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/type.adoc[] page.

`abstract`::
Specify that a given type is an abstract type. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/abstract.adoc[] page.

`owns`::
Specify that a type can own attributes of a given attribute type. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/owns.adoc[] page.

`value`::
Specify a value type of an attribute type. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/value.adoc[] page.

`relates`::
Add a new role for a relation. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/relates.adoc[] page.

`plays`::
Specify that a given type can play a given role (in a given relation). +
For more information, see the xref:statements/plays.adoc[] page.

`@key`::
Add a key constraint to ownership of a given attribute type by a type. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/key.adoc[] page.

`@unique`::
Add a uniqueness constraint to ownership of a given attribute type by a type. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/unique.adoc[] page.

`regex`::
Specify a regular expression that limits values of a given attribute type. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/regex.adoc[] page.

`as`::
Override an inherited attribute type ownership or role playing ability. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/owns.adoc#_usage_with_override[owns] and
xref:statements/plays.adoc#_usage_with_override[plays] pages respectively.

`when`::
Specify a condition of a xref:statements/rule.adoc[rule].

`then`::
Specify a conclusion of a xref:statements/rule.adoc[rule].

== Data statements

Data statement keywords used inside a clause of a data query as a part of a data pattern:
//Data statements are only used in data query patterns.

`isa`::
Adds a constraint for a data instance to be an instance of a type.
Takes into account type inference. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/isa.adoc[] page.

`isa!`::
Adds a constraint for a data instance to be an instance of a type.
Does not take into account type inference. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/isa.adoc[] page.

`is`::
Adds a constraint for two concept variables to be equal both by value and type. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/isa.adoc[] page.

`has`::
Adds a constraint for an ownership of a given attribute by a given data instance. +
For more information, see the xref:statements/has.adoc[] page.

=== Modifiers

`offset`::

See an xref:modifiers/pagination.adoc[example].

`limit`::
Limit the result of a query by the specified number of results. +
See an xref:modifiers/pagination.adoc[example].

`sort`::
Sort the results of a query. +
See an xref:modifiers/sorting.adoc[example].

=== Logic

`or`::
